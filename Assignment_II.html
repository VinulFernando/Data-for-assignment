        <h1>What is GDP?</h1>
        <p> Gross Domestic Product or GDP is a financial degree of the value of merchandise and administrations created in a nation, at a particular time. It is regularly utilized as a strategy to measure the financial advance and wellbeing of a nation. This visualization illustrates the different components that influence the GDP of a nation and vice-versa. It must be noted that whereas GDP could be a reasonably great marker of financial standing, it does not precisely reflect the cost of living and inflation rates of nations. </p>

            <h2>The composition of a GDP</h2>
            <p> By splitting a country's GDP by the end-utilize consumption, we get an idea of where most of the investing within the nation happens. Trades comprise of deals, bargains, endowments, or grants of merchandise and administrations from residents to nonresidents. Fixed capital is the sum of cash businesses have went through on settled resources such as machinery. Government comprises of payments, the government makes such as interest on debt and unemployment payment. Household is the individual consumption of local or foreign merchandise and services.Imports comprise of deals, trade, endowments, or gifts of products and services from nonresidents to residents. They are negative rates to account for the reality that the other uses also incorporate consumption on imports. Finally, inventories are the net changes to stock yields held by businesses. Here we picture the end-use composition of the three most capable nations within the world. </p>

            <h2>The change of GDP with the Population</h2>
            <p>The geography and population of a country are also factors that could have consequences on a country's GDP. A higher population means there are a larger number of able workers, and so a higher workforce. But if large populations are not managed well, high unemployment rates can have adverse effects on the economy.</p>
            <p>As seen on the graph countries with smaller countries tend to have a higher GDP per capita. This may be due to the fac that some small countries have large deposits of natural resources, and this wealth is spread amongst a small population. A lot of small countries also have big financial sectors that generate a lot of money. On the other hand, there does not seem to be an evident correlation between population size and GDP. </p>

            <h2>GDP with Worker Productivity</h2>
            <p>An effective way to measure the productivity of workers in a country is to calculate the ratio between GDP and hours worked - this shows us how long people in the country work to make the money they spend. A large reason why productivity is increasing in general around the world is the emergence of computers and other technology.</p>
             <p> As seen in the graph, countries that have long working hours like South Korea are less productive as opposed to countries with shorter work weeks. This may be due to the fact that working long hours non-stop can eventually cause burnout in workers, which reduces productivity in the long run.</p>

        <h2>Takeaway or the importance of the GDP</h2>
        <p>GDP is perhaps the most closely watched and important economic indicator for both economists and investors alike because it is a representation of the total dollar value of all goods and services produced by an economy over a specific time period. As a measurement, it is often described as being a calculation of the total size of an economy. GDP is also a key factor in using the Taylor rule, which is a primary method used by central bankers to evaluate economic health and set the target interest rates in an economy.</p>
